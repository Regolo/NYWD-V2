						<p>For the past two decades, we have committed ourselves to building trust with our clients and vendors, cultivating business relationships that are rooted in integrity and transparency. At each stage of the partnership, our team is devoted to your success.<br/><br/>
							
							We work closely with you to understand the unique needs of your company, conducting thorough research into your brand’s architecture and securing strong partnerships with our clients worldwide. Above all, we respect the discretion of our vendors by strictly adhering to their licensing policies. Our business model allows you to serve all of your consumer segments while simultaneously bringing you a seamless end-to-end customer experience.<br/><br/>
							
							The NYWD business model is designed to offer our clients the most convenient and timely ordering process in the industry. Rather than operating on a pre-order system, our custom-built B2B platform offers a wide range of inventory that is available at-once, with most orders shipping within a 24 to 48-hour window.<br/><br/>
							
							Our high-resolution product images are taken in-house so that our partners can confidently and accurately shop our online inventory. Complete with advanced back-end features such as API and EDI integration that ensure quick order processing, our robust, scalable platform is equipped to handle unique catalog integration, logistics, invoicing and more. Additionally, we offer mass-customization services such as poly bagging, special ticketing and other logistical requirements.</p>

						<p>Our founders, Aleksandr and Michael, immigrated to the United States in the early 90’s and with hard work, achieved the American dream. Now in the position to pay it forward, Aleksandr and Michael decided to build philanthropy into the core of NYWD. <br/><br/>
						
						Throughout our 20 years in business, we have donated a significant number of frames annually to those who may not be able to access the eyewear they need. In January 2019, we donated 24,571 sunglasses and optical frames to the SLO Noor Foundation and Clinic, an inspiring initiative on the west coast devoted to making quality healthcare available for all. <a href="#0">Read More</a></p>
